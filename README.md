# Past Data Competitions Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains my projects from various data competitions I have participated in. It includes detailed analysis, code, and reports for each competition.

## Competitions

### Big-Contest
- **Objective**: The project focused on the classical performance industry post-COVID-19, aiming to develop a new pricing model addressing the limitations of the existing model.
- **Approach**: The team conducted an in-depth analysis using a dataset containing variables like age, gender, membership types, performance details, seat information, and more. The analysis involved understanding customer satisfaction and profitability, assessing preferences for seats, and predicting appropriate pricing.
- **Results**: Key insights included differences in ticket prices based on genre, day of the week (weekday vs. weekend), time of day, and membership types. The project proposed a new pricing strategy based on these insights, using data-driven method to assign seat rank to enhance customer satisfaction, increase sales, and attract new audiences to classical performances. And suggested a random-forest based model with accuracy of 95% predicting new classified seat rank

### Mirae-Asset Big Data Festival
- **Objective**: The project, titled "Stock Market Weather Station," was designed to provide intuitive and straightforward information about the stock market to investors. It aimed to transform complex stock market data into easily understandable formats using weather-related metaphors.
- **Approach**: We developed several services under this concept, such as "Today's Weather" for real-time market data, "Stock Weather Forecast" for predicting the next day's market trends, and "News Hashtags" for highlighting current news trends in a digestible format. The project involved extensive use of financial data analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques.
- **Results**: The innovative approach of simplifying financial data into weather terms and predictions was expected to make stock market insights more accessible to a broader audience, especially those new to investing.

### Jeju-Island Crop Price Prediction (Dacon)

- **Objective**: The project aimed at predicting crop prices in Jeju Island, focusing on providing accurate and timely forecasts to aid local farmers and businesses in decision-making.
- **Approach**: Leveraging various machine learning techniques, the project involved analyzing historical crop price data, weather patterns, and other relevant factors impacting crop prices. The model was fine-tuned to adapt to the unique agricultural context of Jeju Island.
- **Results**: The predictive model achieved a top 10% placement in the private score, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy in forecasting crop prices.
